<!-- 
    In this session we are going to learn orderedList Tag and Image Tag
    
    1. Ordered List Tag (<ol> and <li>)

  ##  What is the tag?

    The <ol> tag creates an ordered (numbered) list, and each item in the list is wrapped in an <li> tag.

  ##  Where we can use it:

    Use the <ol> tag when the items need to be in a specific order, such as step-by-step instructions or 
    ranking lists.

  ##  Example with code:
    
    <ol>
        <li>First step</li>
        <li>Second step</li>
        <li>Third step</li>
    </ol>

    2. Image Tag (<img>)

    ## What is the tag?
    
    The <img> tag is used to embed an image in a webpage. It requires an src attribute to specify the
     image file and an optional alt attribute for alternative text.
    
    ## Where we can use it:
    
    Use the <img> tag to display images, logos, or illustrations on a webpage.

     ##  Example with code:
     s
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">
