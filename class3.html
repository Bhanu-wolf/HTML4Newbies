<!-- 
      In this session, we are going to learn about:
        - Anchor Tag (<a>)
-->

<!-- 1. What is the Anchor Tag? -->

<!-- 
    The <a> tag in HTML is called the anchor tag. It is used to create hyperlinks, which are clickable links 
    that take you to another page or section of the same page.
-->

<!-- 2. Attributes of the Anchor Tag -->

<!-- 
    - href: This attribute specifies the URL or link where the user will be taken when they click on the link. 
    It stands for "Hypertext REFerence."
    
    - target: This attribute tells the browser where to open the linked document.
        - "_blank": Opens the link in a new tab or window.
        - "_self": Opens the link in the same tab (this is the default behavior).
-->

<!-- 3. Basic Example with Code -->

<!-- 
    Example:

    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

    - href="https://www.example.com" is the URL the user is directed to when they click the link.
    - The text "Visit Example" is what will appear as the clickable link.
-->

<!-- 4. Anchor Links to Sections on the Same Page -->

<!-- 
    You can also use the anchor tag to link to specific sections of the same webpage using an ID.

    Example:

    <a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>

    Then, in your HTML, you have a section with an ID like this:

    <h2 id="section1">Section 1</h2>
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Favorite Websites</title>
</head>
<body>

    <!-- Main Heading -->
