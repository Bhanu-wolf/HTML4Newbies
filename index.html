<!-- ### 1. What is HTML?

**Definition:** HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design web pages. 
It’s like the building blocks of a website. Just like how you need bricks to build a house, you need HTML to create a webpage.

**Analogy:** Think of HTML as the skeleton of a house. 
Just like a skeleton gives shape and structure to a house, HTML gives structure to a web page. 
Without it, there would be no web pages! -->

<!-- ### 2. What are its uses?

**Definition:** HTML is used to create the structure of web pages.
 It helps in organizing content like text, images, links, and videos so that they can be displayed on the internet.

**Example:** When you visit a website, HTML is what tells the browser how to display the text, where to place images, and how to create links to other pages. For instance, if you want to create a simple webpage about your favorite book, you would use HTML to add the title, author, and a picture of the book. -->

<!-- - **HyperText:** 

"Hyper" → means something that is linked.
"Text" → refers to words or content.
HyperText means text that can link to other places on the internet. 
For example, when you click on a link and it takes you to another webpage, that’s HyperText in action!
						
        						OR 

It’s like a web of information where you can jump from one topic to another by clicking on links. -->


<!-- - **Markup:** 
A markup is like a set of instructions. 
It tells the computer how to display the content on the webpage. 
HTML uses special tags (like <p>, <h1>, etc.) to "mark up" the text so the browser knows how it should look. -->


<!-- - **Language:** 

This means that HTML is a set of rules and codes that we use to communicate with web browsers. 
Just like we use English or another language to communicate with each other, we use HTML to communicate with browsers.

HTML is a language that computer uses to understand how to display a webpage on web browser -->

<!-- What are Tags in HTML?
Tags in HTML are like instructions that tell the web browser what each part of the webpage should look like or do. 
They are wrapped inside angle brackets < >, and most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
Opening tag: Tells the browser to start doing something (e.g., start a paragraph).
Closing tag: Tells the browser to stop (e.g., end the paragraph).
The closing tag is written just like the opening tag but with a / (slash) before the tag name. -->

<!-- What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is everything from the opening tag to the closing tag, including the content in between. It's a complete unit that tells the web browser how to display a specific part of a webpage.
An element has three parts:
Opening tag: Tells the browser where the element starts (e.g., <p>).
Content: The actual text or image inside the element.
Closing tag: Tells the browser where the element ends (e.g., </p>). -->
